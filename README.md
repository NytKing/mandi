[Tableau Link](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/akshay1426/viz/mandi_16629255406080/Dashboard1)

## Objective
This was a super quick mini project that I did and the objective was to create a guide which displays the prices of commodities and the paces where they are grown.

## About the data 
The data was was taken from data.gov.in and it did require preprocessing like seperating the comodities into edible stuffs and livestocks.

## Process
1. I used SQL for initial data analysis to find which product was sold the highest, top 10 selling commodities in which state was a commodity sold the highest, categorizing      the commodities etc.,
2. Used Tableau for visualization and used calcualted fields for maximum and minumum for dynamically changing titles
3. Used commodity filter to find the maximum andd minimum price of each comodiity and also the region where it is sold the most.
4. Used a region filter to see what commodity are sold in that particular region in general and how does the price of a particular commodity fare in comparison to the overall 
   price of that commodity across all the regions
